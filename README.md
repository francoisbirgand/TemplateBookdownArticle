# TemplateBookdownArticle

The goal of this repository is to provide the necessary minimum files one needs to write a scientific article in `R Bookdown`. That is correct, not [`R Markdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) but [`R Bookdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/), which is a more advanced version, particularly thanks to the automatic self referencing of tables and figures. An additional advantage to use [`R Bookdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) is that you can add several articles into a single document to create chapters of a thesis for example.

In this template, you will find enough info and tricks to start writing a scientific article. You should be able to render your code into html, word, and pdf outputs.
